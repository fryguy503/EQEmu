# RoF2 achievement support

This implementation is based on the RoF2 client. The newer ToB resource
files are optional presentation data; explicit
progression selection can additionally author criteria only for narrow,
independently validated level, level-locked progression, class skill-cap,
item-ownership, travel, dependency, tradeskill, spent-AA, and zone-scoped
named-kill shapes. Native Slayer race-kill policy is a separate explicit
opt-in. Nothing that is unique to ToB's packet protocol is sent to RoF2.

See [Achievement content authoring](achievement_authoring.md) for the database
relationships, criterion examples, rewards, and quest API recipes.
See [RoF2 Select Reward support](reward_selection.md) for the shared reward
catalog, client lanes, and claim lifecycle.

for the audited native, quest-owned, presentation-only, and unavailable IDs.

## Runtime flow

At zone startup, `AchievementManager` loads enabled definitions, categories,
components, evaluation criteria, rewards, and achievement-backed spell
restrictions. It keeps definitions in deterministic achievement-ID order and
builds the compressed definition packet once. Invalid or conflicting server
policy fails zone startup instead of leaving a partially active system.

At character connect, `ClientAchievementState`:

1. creates one state entry for every loaded definition;
2. loads completion and component progress from the character database;
3. resets version-mismatched definitions when their reset policy is enabled;
4. retries rewards whose delivery API explicitly failed;
5. reconciles durable facts such as level, zone, completed tasks, skills,
   inventory, spent AA points, and prerequisite achievements;
6. evaluates completion, visibility, and lock policy; and
7. sends definitions, the dense primary state, and progress in that exact
   order.

Runtime events update only criteria indexed for that event. A component update
is persisted before it is exposed to the client or used to complete an
achievement. A failed write is rolled back in memory.

Durable source facts are ordered before achievement persistence. Task and
skill hooks run after their source write succeeds. Level facts run only after
character data commits; spent AA facts run only after successful AA-state saves.
Inventory writes instead mark ownership dirty
after every persistence attempt, including failed or ambiguous attempts.
The next client process boundary reads the durable final rows, so a multi-step
move is never evaluated while an item temporarily exists in both source and
destination.

All other achievement state updates, including Lua or Perl progress/completion
calls made by equip and unequip events, queue behind a dirty ownership fact or
an active inventory transaction. They replay only after authoritative
ownership succeeds; a failed read retains both the dirty flag and the queue for
retry. The disconnect path performs this flush before destroying client state,
but deliberately leaves reward delivery to the recoverable login ledger.

RoF2 item moves, multi-item moves, pet moves, stacked reward placement,
disarm, bandolier swaps, and GM snapshot restoration use checked atomic
persistence where a partial relocation could otherwise create false ownership.
No statement reconnects or retries after a strict transaction starts. A failed
statement rolls the transaction back. A lost COMMIT response remains
ambiguous, so runtime inventory is disconnected and reloaded rather than being
used for another achievement-sensitive operation.

Achievement state is available to quest events during connect, but RoF2
incremental packets and queued rewards remain suppressed until the initial
definition, primary-state, and progress packets have been sent.

Completions discovered while reconciling durable facts at login are persisted
before those packets and queued for presentation. Once the initial three-packet
model is installed, newly completed achievements are announced in completion
order at a bounded rate. Achievements already present in
`character_achievements` are loaded without being announced again.

Each announcement uses RoF2's native earned-achievement packet. The client
builds the localized clickable achievement link from the supplied serialized
state metadata and its locally loaded definition, and plays its
`Achievement.wav` asset. A separate narrow inter-zone guild message carries
the same metadata so other RoF2 guild members receive the native
guild-achievement line and link. The earning client is excluded from that
guild delivery because it already receives the more verbose local completion
line. Guild membership is captured when the completion occurs, so a throttled
announcement cannot leak into a guild joined afterward. Notification delivery
is best effort after durable completion; a lost world connection never rolls
back or repeats achievement persistence.

## RoF2 wire protocol

The supported RoF2 opcodes are:

| Purpose and direction | Emulated opcode | RoF2 opcode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definitions, server to client | `OP_AchievementDefinitions` | `0xDAB0` |
| Full comparison/summary snapshot, server to client | `OP_AchievementState` | `0x059D` |
| Primary state (dense initialization and sparse updates), server to client | `OP_AchievementUpdate` | `0x618F` |
| Earned notification, server to client | `OP_AchievementEarned` | `0x17F8` |
| Progress counts, server to client | `OP_AchievementProgress` | `0x2B42` |
| Window request, client to server | `OP_AchievementRequest` | `0x47CB` |
| Open the normal achievement window, server to client | `OP_AchievementWindow` | `0x171E` |
| Compare request, client to server | `OP_AchievementCompareRequest` | `0x1665` |
| Local-link inspection request, client to server | `OP_AchievementLinkRequest` | `0x675D` |
| Authoritative link/inspection reply, server to client | `OP_AchievementComparisonReply` | `0x28E0` |
| Claimable/pending Select Reward manager, bidirectional | `OP_AchievementReward` | `0x6411` |
| Read-only Select Reward preview manager, bidirectional | `OP_RewardSelection` | `0x6471` |

RoF2 does not use the newer `Resources/Achievements` definition files. The
zone sends its read-only definitions, primary character state, and progress
during zone entry and resends that same state when the achievement window
requests it.

The definitions packet is a little-endian uncompressed-size prefix followed by
a zlib stream. Its inflated body is:

```text
u32 category_count
Category[category_count]
u32 achievement_count
Achievement[achievement_count]
```

The content database uses `parent_id = 0` for top-level categories. RoF2 reads
that wire field as signed and only enumerates roots whose parent is `-1`, so
serialization translates database root `0` to wire value `0xFFFFFFFF`. Nested
category parent IDs are sent unchanged.

RoF2 renders every transmitted root and child even when it has no achievements.
The zone therefore sends only categories with associations to enabled
definitions plus the complete ancestor chain required to reach their roots.
Child lists are rebuilt from that retained hierarchy. An enabled definition
without a valid category association, or an active hierarchy with a missing
parent, reserved ID zero, or cycle, prevents achievement content from loading.

An achievement definition contains four component vectors in type order
0, 1, 2, 3. The byte immediately before those vectors is RoF2's `persistent`
flag and is written as `1`; the following dword is the definition `version`.
The final two fields are RoF2 points and the `has_reward` value.

The comparison/summary snapshot has no count or achievement IDs. It has exactly
one state in the same order as the definition vector:

```text
i16 status                 // 0 completed, 1 open, 2 locked, 3 hidden
u16 type_1_bits[ceil(n/16)]
u16 type_2_bits[ceil(n/16)]
u16 type_0_bits[ceil(n/16)]
if completed:
    u32 completion_time
```

Bits are least-significant-bit first. RoF2 deliberately ignores component type
3 in state, comparison counts, and progress processing. The server therefore
keeps type 3 only as definition/presentation text: it cannot have an enabled
criterion, receive scripted progress, affect lock or completion state, persist
progress, emit a progress record, or grant a reward through completion.

Primary state uses a serial, a dense/sparse flag, and a count. The zone sends
one dense record for every definition during initialization; dense record `i`
targets definition `i`. Later sparse records carry their definition index.
RoF2's main achievement list and summary are built from this primary model.
The separate `0x059D` snapshot is comparison-only: its handler enables Compare
mode and explicitly shows the achievement window. It must therefore be sent
only in response to a validated Compare request.

Each progress record is:

```text
u32 achievement_id
u32 component_id
u32 requirement_id
u32 requirement_type
u32 current_count
```

The stable aggregate key used by this server is component sequence plus
component type. RoF2 stores distinct requirement records but sums every record
matching an achievement and component. Changing that key between initial and
live updates would therefore double the displayed count.

The earned notification follows its persisted state update and contains:

```text
u32 achiever_spawn_id
u32 achievement_id
u32 sound_id             // 3695, RoF2 Achievement.wav
char achievement_link_data[] // NUL-terminated
```

The final string is not visible notification text. It is RoF2's native
caret-delimited link state:

```text
player_name^achievement_id^status^
type_1_signed_bit_words^
type_2_signed_bit_words^
type_0_signed_bit_words^
[completion_timestamp^ when status is completed]
type_1_counts^type_2_counts^type_0_counts^
```

Every scalar ends in `^`. Each bit word packs 16 components least-significant
bit first, is cast to signed `i16`, and is printed in decimal. The client looks
up the achievement ID and supplies the visible definition name when it wraps
this metadata as:

```text
\x12 + "3" + achievement_link_data + "'" + achievement_name + \x12
```

The server must send only the caret-delimited metadata in the earned and guild
packets; adding that raw chat-link envelope server-side would wrap it twice.
When a player clicks the resulting link, RoF2 first resolves
`achievement_id` in its loaded definition catalog. If the linked player is
still local to the zone, the client sends `OP_AchievementLinkRequest`
(`0x675D`). That variable-length request carries the NUL-terminated player
name, achievement ID, serialized state/count data in component order 1, 2, 0,
and a trailing flag. The server validates the exact size against the loaded
definition, discards the client-supplied state as untrusted presentation data,
looks up the named local player, and replies with that player's authoritative
state on `OP_AchievementComparisonReply` (`0x28E0`). For a nonlocal linked
player, the client opens the state embedded in the original link without this
round trip.

Other guild members receive `OP_GuildUpdate` action `3`, with the achiever name
in its fixed 64-byte field, the achievement ID at offset `0x50`, and the same
NUL-terminated link metadata at offset `0x54`. Its packet size is therefore
`84 + metadata length + 1`, not a fixed 85 bytes. The server sends this form
only to other RoF2 clients in the matching guild.

When the hidden achievement window is opened, RoF2 sends an empty (0-byte) or
one-byte `0x30` payload on `OP_AchievementRequest`. The server responds by
idempotently resending definitions, the dense primary state, and progress in
that order, then sends the zero-payload `OP_AchievementWindow` (`0x171E`) to
show the normal view. Requests are bounded to one response per client per
second.

The Compare button sends exactly eight bytes on
`OP_AchievementCompareRequest` (`0x1665`):

```text
u32 target_spawn_id
u32 requester_spawn_id
```

The server requires the requester ID to match the sending client and the target
to be that client's current nearby player target. It returns the target's full
definition-ordered snapshot on `OP_AchievementState` (`0x059D`). This is
the only path that sends `0x059D`; RoF2 uses it to enter Compare mode and open
the window. It is separate from the per-achievement `0x28E0` link/inspection
reply and from the reward action family.

RoF2 has two Select Reward managers using the same payload family.
`OP_AchievementReward` (`0x6411`) is claim-capable: it displays **Choose** and
permits action `3`. `OP_RewardSelection` (`0x6471`) is read-only: it displays
the full reward choices, details, Inspect, and Preview controls but hides
**Choose** and refuses to dispatch a claim.

| Action | Direction | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Server to client | Populate the native reward window; the opcode selects claimable or read-only behavior |
| `1` | Bidirectional | Inspect an item entry in the reward window; this is a distinct item-inspection exchange and must not be treated as Compare |
| `3` | Bidirectional on `0x6411` only | Claim a selected option; the server echoes the identities and sets the reply success byte only after validated delivery |
| `5` | Client to server on `0x6411` | View Reward request carrying the zero-based definition index |
| `6` | Client to server on either manager | Restore all eligible pending rewards on `0x6411` |
| `7` | Server to client | Replace the manager with zero or more tabbed reward displays |

Action `5` is eight bytes: the action followed by the zero-based definition
index used by the definition and dense-state packets. Although the request
arrives on `0x6411`, the response is conditional. An earned, outstanding
selection is returned on `0x6411`, exposing **Choose**; an unearned,
already-claimed, automatic-only, or otherwise non-pending reward is returned
on `0x6471`, which removes **Choose** while preserving the complete preview.
Action `7` carries a count and a complete action-`0` reward record for each
tab. The server uses it on the claimable lane so outstanding achievement and
task rewards can coexist in the stock tabbed window. An empty action `7`
clears either manager when no display remains.

Action `3` carries the pending reward ID, reward-set ID, and selected option
ID; its reply has the same identities plus the success byte. The action-`1`
request is exactly five `u32` values: action, reward-set ID, option ID,
reward-entry ID, and item ID. Every displayed reward entry uses its nonzero
canonical `rewards.reward_id` as the 32-bit reward-entry ID. The
server verifies all three identities and requires the item to belong to that
exact loaded option. Its reply is action `1`, the item ID, then the ordinary
RoF2 serialized item body. A RoF2-only outbound encoder reuses the existing
item serializer while keeping actions `0`, `3`, and `7` as raw reward
payloads; sending a normal `OP_ItemLinkResponse` would not populate the reward
window's item cache.

Database option IDs are scoped to their reward set, but RoF2 indexes option
detail records by option ID across the entire displayed manager. Before an
action-`7` replacement, the zone assigns every displayed option a unique wire
ID. Inspect and claim requests are translated back to the canonical
`reward_options.option_id` before provider validation and ledger
updates. This permits different achievement and task sets to use ordinary
local option IDs such as `1`, `100`, and `110` without cross-populating tabs.

The five optional client resource files do not contain reward-set, option, or
grant contents. Their imported `has_reward` hint is therefore not proof that a
usable reward exists. Runtime enables View Reward only when that achievement
has loaded automatic reward entries or a valid selectable set.

## Runtime policy and authoring boundary

The normalized content tables, character-state tables, criterion values, reward
types, SQL examples, and Lua/Perl recipes are documented in
[Achievement content authoring](achievement_authoring.md). The shared reward
catalog and claim state machine are documented in
[RoF2 Select Reward support](reward_selection.md).

The RoF2 progress packet calls its component fields `requirement_id` and
`requirement_type`; they do not identify rows in `achievement_criteria`.
Criteria are server-side event bindings. Several alternatives may feed one
visible component, while component behavior and `required_count` decide
whether that component is required for completion.

Completion, progress, reward claims, and cast requirements are character-scoped.
The definition catalog and its zero-based indices are global. Positive Own Item
and Skill Cap criteria that resolve to one class hide the definition from other
classes without changing its global index, so class Epics and skill families do
not become account-wide. Shared-bank ownership may satisfy an active
character's criterion, but completion and rewards still belong to that
character.

Component identity is
`(achievement_id, component_type, component_id)`; sequence is presentation
order. Types `0` through `2` carry evaluated state. Type `3` is
presentation-only because RoF2 has no state or progress channel for it.
Imported component counts are presentation defaults; every evaluated component
uses the criterion's explicit nonzero count.

Definition `version` is sent to RoF2 and stored with character state. Version
`0` is valid initially. When the version changes and
`reset_on_version_change` is enabled, completion, progress, and reward ledgers
are rebuilt together. Invalid or conflicting enabled content makes the
achievement snapshot fail closed.

Native event feeds cover level changes, credited NPC type/race/name kills,
durably recorded task completion, zone entry, corpse loot, authoritative item
ownership, successful tradeskills, persisted raw skills and database-backed
skill caps, spent AA, and prerequisite achievement completion. Login and zone
reconciliation replay durable absolute facts: current level, completed tasks,
inventory, shared bank, keyring, raw skills and caps, spent AA, and completed
prerequisites. It does not invent historical kills, prior zone visits, loot, or
combines that the server did not persist.

Owned-item evaluation reads persisted inventory, shared-bank, keyring, cursor,
bag, and augment state. A fresh ownership pass guards any completion whose
required, visibility, unlock, or blocker policy depends on item ownership. This
prevents stale shared-bank state from granting a reward. Periodic reconciliation
also makes another character's shared-bank change visible without adding a
cross-zone achievement protocol.

Scripted group, raid, expedition, and shared-task updates are expanded by world
into durable per-character state updates, including members in other zones or
offline. Progress requests are monotonic floors and completion requests are
idempotent. Version mismatches or invalid components remain blocked for
diagnosis; processing leases recover rows abandoned by a stopped zone.

Reward definitions are provider-neutral, but achievement and task authorization,
pending selections, and delivery ledgers remain separate. Completion is
reconciled with the achievement ledger on login. Automatic delivery runs after
the completing game event finishes, and selectable rewards wait for a validated
client choice. A confirmed entry is never delivered again; an ambiguous
in-flight result is not retried automatically because the underlying grant may
already have committed.

Lua and Perl expose player reads and progress/completion writes plus
world-routed group, raid, expedition, and shared-task operations. A successful
remote call confirms handoff to world, not that every recipient has already
applied the update. See the authoring guide's
[quest scripting recipes](achievement_authoring.md#quest-scripting) for the
complete API and return-value contract.
## Spell restrictions

`achievement_cast_requirements` maps an existing spell restriction number to
one or more achievement requirements. All rows for one restriction number must
pass. Unmapped values continue through the existing spell-restriction switch.

An installation may author mappings such as:

- restriction `39281`: the achievement must not be completed;
- restriction `42280`: the achievement must be completed.

A restriction row becomes active only when its referenced achievement exists
and is enabled. Structural migrations do not seed content-specific mappings.

## Importing optional ToB presentation data

The importer validates exactly five resource files. Without progression
selection options, it writes only the five presentation tables:

```powershell
python utils\scripts\import_achievement_resources.py `
  "F:\EQ1\client\EQ TOB Client\Resources\Achievements" `
  --output achievements-ui.sql
```

Use `--validate-only` to inspect the resource set without producing SQL.
`--strict-references` turns the known dangling references in the source files
into errors. Every required resource file must contain at least one data row;
an empty snapshot is rejected before SQL generation.

To export the five presentation tables back to resource files, use the standard
MySQL command-line client through the companion exporter:

```powershell
python utils\scripts\export_achievement_resources.py `
  exported-achievements `
  --database peq `
  --login-path eqemu
```

With neither credential option, the client uses its normal MySQL defaults.
Use `--login-path` for a `mysql_config_editor` login or
`--defaults-extra-file` for a MySQL option file; the exporter does not accept a
password on its command line. The output is exactly the five presentation
files consumed by the importer. Re-import the exported directory to review a
database-to-resource round trip; server-only criteria, rewards, versions, and
character state are not part of those files.

To enable a progression-era slice while importing the complete presentation
snapshot, pass `--enable-through-expansion`. Expansion names and common
abbreviations are accepted case-insensitively:

```powershell
python utils\scripts\import_achievement_resources.py `
  "F:\EQ1\client\EQ TOB Client\Resources\Achievements" `
  --enable-through-expansion don `
  --output achievements-ui-don.sql
```

This example enables definitions categorized under each expansion from
EverQuest through Dragons of Norrath. It also enables the unambiguous
`General / Level`, level-locked `General / Progression`, and class-specific
`General / Skills` milestone definitions through DoN's level cap of 70.
Era-appropriate `General / Class` Epic definitions are included as well: the
original classes' Epic 1.0 rows at launch, Beastlord at Luclin, Berserker at
Gates of Discord, and Epic 1.5/2.0 at Omens of War. The level cap may be
overridden with `--max-level`; using `--max-level` without an expansion selects
only the three level-derived General families and does not infer an Epic era.

Level criteria are generated only when the definition has the exact validated
`General / Level` shape in the resource snapshot: achievement ID and
`Level N` name agree, and it has exactly one state-bearing component with
sequence `1`, type `1`, component ID `N`, description `Reach Level N`, and
required count one. A mismatch aborts the import instead of guessing. Type `3`
presentation-only components do not affect this validation.

The level-locked `Reach Level N` rows are a separate Progression family. They
receive the same absolute Level fact only when the definition has the exact
client shape: matching name and description, one sequence-0/type-1 `Reach level
N` component whose component ID is the achievement ID, required count one, and
the `On a Level Locked Server` type-3 marker. Through DoN this adds the level
60, 65, and 70 rows. It intentionally does not infer the neighboring
level-limited raid challenges.

Class proficiency rows under `General / Skills` use the Skill Cap event rather
than a static Skill Value. Every definition must identify one reviewed EQ class
in its type-3 marker and every state component must exactly say `Reach the
maximum skill in Skill at level N.` The importer maps those client names to
stable EQ class and skill IDs. At runtime, the criterion verifies the current
class and level, resolves the server's DB-backed maximum for that class, skill,
and milestone level, rejects a zero/unavailable cap, and compares the raw skill
against that resolved maximum. A malformed name, unknown skill, duplicate
skill, class mismatch, or displayed-count mismatch rejects the complete
definition instead of partially enabling it.

The selected expansion definitions also receive criteria for these validated
shapes:

- A leaf name ending in ` Traveler` with exactly one sequence-1, type-1
  `Visit ...` component and required count one receives a Boolean Zone Enter
  criterion. Its zone is decoded as `(achievement_id // 100) % 1000`.
  Muramite Proving Grounds Trials achievement `930400` is the one validated
  multi-component exception; its six ordered components map to zones 304
  through 309.
- A type-1 or type-2 state component whose description exactly names one
  uniquely selected, different achievement receives an Achievement Complete
  criterion. Type 1 is Required and type 2 is Optional. Duplicate names and
  self references are reported and skipped; a generated dependency cycle
  aborts the import. A structurally validated direct event mapping owns its
  component and takes precedence over this name-only inference. Suppressed
  dependency identities are emitted as narrowly scoped `enabled = 0` updates
  so rerunning the importer also repairs rows generated by an older version.
- An exact `Hunter of X` definition under a Hunter or Hunts category receives
  zone-scoped NPC Name Kill criteria only when `X` resolves to a validated
  `X Traveler`. Duplicate Hunter names must also resolve through one matching
  structural ID family, which selects the original zone definition instead of
  a newer enhanced copy. Exact child-achievement components are excluded,
  required counts must be one, and duplicate canonical identities or name-hash
  collisions are reported and skipped. Raid and `Conqueror` prose is never
  converted automatically.
- Selected `General / Keys` state components and era-appropriate Epic
  components receive Own Item criteria by an exact, case-insensitive item-name
  join against the destination server's `items` table. This resolves every
  duplicate item ID with the same name as an OR alternative, which covers both
  legacy and newer copies such as the Blade of Tactics and Blade of Strategy.
  Epic rows also carry the validated EQ class ID in `target_id2`; keys use zero.
  Ownership reconciliation checks carried inventory, bank, shared bank, cursor,
  and the durable keyring, so retaining a keyring entry satisfies its item
  criterion. Item-name joins never use client component IDs as item IDs.
  Components with the same item name twice cannot be assigned safely and are
  rejected as a whole; the Beastlord Epic 1.0 pair is the known DoN case.

Servers imported before these criteria were available must rerun the importer
with their normal `--enable-through-expansion` and `--max-level` selection,
apply the generated SQL, and use `#reload achievements global` (or restart
zones). Changing `enabled` alone cannot synthesize the Skill Cap or item-name
rows.

If the database's enabled flags have already been curated manually, add
`--preserve-enable-state`. Selection options still generate the corresponding
criteria, and a selected definition missing from the database is inserted
enabled, but the SQL emits no enabled-state update for definitions that already
exist:

```powershell
python utils\scripts\import_achievement_resources.py `
  "F:\EQ1\client\EQ TOB Client\Resources\Achievements" `
  --enable-through-expansion don `
  --max-level 70 `
  --max-tradeskill-skill 300 `
  --max-aa-spent 150 `
  --preserve-enable-state `
  --output achievements-ui-don-refresh.sql
```

This option cannot be combined with `--exact-enable-selection`, whose purpose
is to replace the imported snapshot's enabled-state selection.

Direct global tradeskill milestones are intentionally not pulled into an
expansion selection. They require an explicit skill-cap opt-in:

```powershell
python utils\scripts\import_achievement_resources.py `
  "F:\EQ1\client\EQ TOB Client\Resources\Achievements" `
  --enable-through-expansion don `
  --max-tradeskill-skill 300 `
  --exact-enable-selection `
  --output achievements-ui-don.sql
```

Only exact `Skill (N)` definitions under the top-level Tradeskill hierarchy
with a matching `Reach N skill in Skill` component, matching definition text,
component ID equal to achievement ID, and required count one are enabled by
this option. An explicit table maps the client names to stable EQ skill IDs;
other Tradeskill definitions are not selected by this option.

Spent-AA milestones are also global General definitions rather than
expansion-category definitions, so they require a separate explicit cutoff:

```powershell
python utils\scripts\import_achievement_resources.py `
  "F:\EQ1\client\EQ TOB Client\Resources\Achievements" `
  --enable-through-expansion don `
  --max-aa-spent 150 `
  --exact-enable-selection `
  --output achievements-ui-don.sql
```

The value `150` is only an operator-selected example; the newer client
snapshot does not identify the expansion in which an AA-spent milestone was
introduced. The importer never derives an AA cutoff from
`--enable-through-expansion`. This option selects only exact
`N Alternate Advancement Points` definitions under `General / Advancement`
whose description says they are completed by spending `N` points and which
have exactly one sequence-1, type-1 `Spend N Alternate Advancement Points`
state component with required count one. It emits an absolute Boolean
Alternate Advancement criterion with target value `N`; malformed shapes are
reported and left disabled. The component ID is retained only as its client
presentation identity; newer milestones intentionally stop using the
achievement ID as their component ID.

If the General / Advancement definitions were imported or manually enabled
before this option was available, rerun the importer with the intended
`--max-aa-spent` cutoff and apply its SQL. Enabling definitions alone does not
create evaluation criteria. The generated SQL upserts only the validated
AA-spent criterion identities, so a presentation replacement is not required:

```powershell
python utils\scripts\import_achievement_resources.py `
  "F:\EQ1\client\EQ TOB Client\Resources\Achievements" `
  --max-aa-spent 150 `
  --preserve-enable-state `
  --output achievements-aa-spent.sql
```

Use `--preserve-enable-state` on this rerun when retaining manually adjusted
`enabled` flags; exact selection would disable other imported definitions not
selected by this command. After applying the SQL, use
`#reload achievements global` (or restart active zone processes) to load the
new criteria.

Slayer is also global rather than expansion-scoped and is never inferred from
`--enable-through-expansion`. On the initial activation, or when existing
imported Slayer definitions are still disabled, enable it with the explicit
switch and omit `--preserve-enable-state`:

```powershell
python utils\scripts\import_achievement_resources.py `
  "F:\EQ1\client\EQ TOB Client\Resources\Achievements" `
  --enable-slayer `
  --output achievements-slayer.sql
```

For a later criteria-only refresh of Slayer definitions that are already
enabled, add `--preserve-enable-state` to retain their current enabled flags.
That option deliberately emits no enabled-state update for definitions already
in the database, so it cannot perform the initial Slayer activation.

Direct Slayer components use native `NpcRaceKill` criteria in Increment mode.
Each credited raid, group, or solo NPC death emits the NPC's stable base race
ID through the ordinary achievement event path and increments
`character_achievement_progress`. This implementation does not read, update,
replace, or depend on the server's separate custom `account_kill_counts`
system, and it does not fabricate historical race kills during login replay.

The importer maps an exact, reviewed Slayer component vocabulary to RoF2 race
IDs from `common/races.h`. A direct Slayer definition is rejected as a whole
when any component has an unsupported type, invalid required count, unknown
race term, or empty mapping; it is never partially enabled. Quoted Slayer
meta-achievements are selected only when every required name resolves uniquely
to another safely selected Slayer definition, and their generated
Achievement Complete dependencies remain cycle-checked. Rejection reasons are
written into the generated SQL comments and validation report for review.

`--enable-slayer` applies to the complete validated top-level Slayer hierarchy,
not the DoN category boundary; combining it with
`--enable-through-expansion don` does not restrict Slayer selection to DoN.
The accepted definition and criterion counts depend on the client snapshot and
the current reviewed race map, so inspect the generated validation report
rather than relying on a fixed expected count. Ambiguous race terms and
later-client terms without a reviewed RoF2 race mapping remain rejected, along
with any dependent meta-achievements. Combine the switch with other selection
options only when that whole Slayer scope is intended.

The item join is deliberately exact rather than fuzzy. Some newer-client Key
rows describe non-item zone/progression flags, and some old key display names
do not exist in a destination server's `items` table. Those rows do not gain a
false item criterion merely because a similarly named item exists; they still
need a reviewed server-authored criterion or quest-script completion call.
For the reported concrete cases, Bone Crafted Key resolves to the destination
item ID (PEQ ID 6378), while Warrior Epic 1.0 resolves all exact Blade of
Tactics and Blade of Strategy item-ID variants.

The selection is derived from the client category hierarchy, not achievement
ID ranges. By default, definitions outside the selection are inserted disabled,
while pre-existing definitions outside the selection retain their current
enable state. Selected pre-existing definitions are explicitly enabled. To
make the imported snapshot's enable state exactly match the selection, add
`--exact-enable-selection`. That option disables only unselected achievement
IDs present in the validated resource snapshot, so custom achievements absent
from those files are untouched. The importer still writes the complete
category and presentation snapshot. It cannot be combined with
`--replace-existing`, whose global deletion semantics would contradict the
custom-ID guarantee.

Enablement makes definitions available to the runtime and client. The
validated shapes above are the only definitions for which the importer creates
evaluation policy. Task/quest completion, recipe success, non-item key flags,
and bespoke raid mechanics still need reviewed `achievement_criteria` rows or
quest-script calls. Client component IDs remain presentation identities and
are never treated as task, NPC type, zone, item, skill, or
dependent-achievement IDs.

The category cutoff identifies the expansion branch in which content is
presented; it is not generally a reliable achievement-release chronology. For
the audited DoN profile, the importer therefore applies an additional
fail-closed RoF2 boundary to this newer client snapshot: Traveler zone IDs above
345 and reserved later-use zone 213 are removed, their structural ID families
are removed, newer enhanced availability rows are removed, and parents that
require a removed exact-name child are pruned recursively. Optional removed
children do not prune a parent. Guild Lobby and Guild Hall zones 344 and 345
remain in the DoN slice.

The supplied ToB set currently validates as 286 categories, 6,203
achievements, 6,358 associations, 30,939 components, and 3,953 displayed
counts. Through DoN it selects 982 definitions and emits 4,658 fixed criteria
plus 107 exact-item-name mappings: 14 ordinary level, 3 level-locked
Progression, 1,629 class Skill Cap, 279 Traveler, 545 dependency, and 2,188
zone-scoped Hunter rows. The item mappings cover 38 selected Key definitions
and 47 additionally selected Epic definitions; one duplicate-name Epic shape
is rejected. Adding the explicit tradeskill cap of 300 selects 1,057
definitions and emits 4,733 fixed criteria plus the same item mappings,
including 75 Skill Value rows. The DoN compatibility boundary removes 38 newer
or outlier definitions from otherwise older category branches. It skips 30
self dependencies, supersedes three false name-inferred dependencies where
ordinary Level 60/65/70 components collide with level-locked Progression
names, and skips 22 Hunter definitions whose location does not resolve exactly;
no selected level-derived, Traveler, ambiguous or invalid dependency, named
component, or within-zone hash collision is rejected. The complete resource
set also contains one missing category reference, 98 association references to
missing achievements, and 99 component references to missing achievements.
Those warnings are preserved rather than guessed around.

Without progression selection options, new definitions created by this
importer are disabled and existing definitions retain their current `enabled`
value. Review the RoF2 presentation, author explicit criteria and rewards, and
then enable only the definitions intended for production.

`--replace-existing` performs a global exact presentation snapshot using
temporary key tables. Do not use it on a mixed/custom content database unless
that deletion scope is intended. It removes stale presentation rows while
preserving server-authored fields such as definition version, reset policy,
enable state, component descriptions, criteria, rewards, restrictions, and
character state.

Generated criteria are deliberately upsert-only: the importer does not delete
other criterion identities because it cannot distinguish older generated rows
from server-authored policy without provenance. Before deploying output from a
later importer policy or a materially changed resource snapshot, review and
remove any obsolete previously generated identities explicitly. The current
DoN generator should therefore be deployed from a clean criteria import or
with a reviewed, narrowly scoped cleanup; it never issues a broad criteria
delete.

The optional crosswalk imports ToB field 6 as `has_reward`. Runtime still
derives the effective reward-button state from server-authored reward content.
ToB field 7 is retained as uninterpreted `client_flag` data for lossless import
and export, but is never serialized to RoF2. These structural mappings do not
infer rewards or packet layouts. No ToB packet layout or reward behavior is
used by the runtime implementation;

## Operational controls

- `Achievements:EnableAchievements` enables loading, evaluation, persistence,
  and RoF2 packets.
- `Achievements:GrantRewards` enables configured reward delivery.
- `Achievements:GuildMemberNotifications` (default `true`) controls whether
  completion announcements are sent to other online guild members. Local
  completion sound, chat, and link delivery are unchanged.
- `Achievements:NearbyPlayerNotifications` (default `true`) controls whether
  the native completion announcement is also sent to nearby RoF2 players in
  the same zone. This path is independent of guild announcements, so a nearby
  guild member can receive both when both rules are enabled.
- `Achievements:NearbyPlayerNotificationDistance` (default `200`) sets the
  maximum three-dimensional distance for nearby completion announcements. A
  value of `0` disables proximity delivery even when the Boolean rule is on.
- `Achievements:CompletionNotificationIntervalMS` is the minimum delay between
  queued completion announcements. The default is 750 milliseconds; values
  below one millisecond are clamped to one.
- `Achievements:OwnershipReconcileIntervalMS` controls periodic authoritative
  owned-item reconciliation for live account-wide shared-bank changes. The
  default is 30 seconds; `0` disables only the periodic pass. Existing clients
  sample this rule when their achievement state loads, so reconnect them after
  changing it.
- Non-shared task-completion criteria require
  `TaskSystem:RecordCompletedTasks`, because the durable history row is the
  replay and reward-safety boundary.
- `#reload achievements` reloads achievement content in the current zone
  process. `#reload achievements global` reloads every zone process, including
  sleeping processes that may boot a zone later.
- `#achievement` is an online-player administration command. It targets the
  selected player, or the issuing GM when no player is selected. `find`,
  `list`, and `inspect` report loaded definitions and current component state;
  `set`, `add`, and `complete` use the normal persistent state-update path.
  `reset <achievement_id>` removes completion and progress while preserving
  reward ledgers. `reset <achievement_id> rewards` explicitly clears those
  ledgers too, allowing the rewards to be granted again after recompletion.
- Changing an `achievements.enabled` row needs only the achievement reload.
  After changing the `Achievements:EnableAchievements` rule itself, reload
  rules first and achievements second so the content reload samples the new
  rule value; for a global change, run `#reload rules global` followed by
  `#reload achievements global`.
- Reloading stages and validates a complete replacement before activating it.
  If loading fails, the existing achievement content and connected-client state
  remain active.
- After a successful reload, connected clients rebuild their indexed
  achievement state against the replacement definitions, reconcile durable
  progress, and receive fresh definition and state packets. Already-persisted
  completions are not announced again; newly satisfied definitions complete
  and announce normally. Reloading an empty or rule-disabled system also sends
  a real empty client model so stale window content is cleared. Reward delivery
  remains protected by the durable claim ledger.
- If one loaded-client state rebuild fails after a successful content swap,
  the replacement content remains active and that client's achievement state
  automatically retries loading once per second. Zoning, reconnecting, or a
  later reload also rebuilds it. The server logs the character and sends
  administrators a partial-reload warning. A zone restart is not required after
  changing definitions, criteria, rewards, restrictions, or enabled flags.
- The migrations create the engine schema but intentionally do not invent
  gameplay criteria or rewards. Importing ToB presentation data is optional;
  definitions outside the importer's exact Level, level-locked Progression,
  class Skill Cap, Own Item, Traveler, dependency, direct-tradeskill,
  AA-spent, Hunter, and explicitly opted-in Slayer shapes still require
  reviewed server-authored criteria and, when desired, reward rows.
- Content update `9329` installs achievement definitions, evaluation criteria,
  cast requirements, and the shared reward catalog.
- Character update `9330` installs achievement progress, reward-delivery state,
  task-reward occurrence state, and the durable pending state-update queue used by
  cross-zone group, raid, dynamic-zone, and shared-task scripting.
  The updates remain separate because EQEmu may place content and character
  state on different database connections.
